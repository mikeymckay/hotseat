For more information about the concept go here: http://wiki.github.com/mikeymckay/hotseat/the-concept

Needs google gears.
Needs couchdb installed.
Put this stuff in /usr/share/couchdb/www/ (softlink works).
Then goto: http://localhost:5984/_utils/hotseat/index.html (need to specify index.html)

This code is pure cowboy. Uploading it to github just because jeffrafter asked to see it.
